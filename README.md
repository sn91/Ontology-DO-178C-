# DO-178C Traceability Ontology

This repository contains the ontology developed as part of the master's thesis titled  
**"Traceability and Change Impact Analysis of DO-178C-based Systems using Web Ontology"**.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
The ontology models traceability relationships among system requirements, software requirements (high-level and low-level), source code artifacts, verification results, and DO-178C certification objectives. It is designed to support change impact analysis in safety-critical airborne software systems developed in agile or DevOps environments.

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `Ontology-1.ttl` â€“ The main ontology models DO-178Câ€™s lifecycle processes and traceability between artifacts.
- `Ontology-2.ttl` â€“ This Ontology is mainly focused on Control Category assignments and traceability between objectives and data items.
